Connor has been taking some great\n        photographs of nature and birds, and Amanda has been crushing through\n        one jigsaw puzzle after another. We are together in a small apartment,\n        but conditions are as ideal as they could be because of the great\n        company we share together; it makes it so clear more than ever that we\n        are excellent partners.\n      </p>\n\n      <p>\n        We were hoping to have our wedding this October, but having the wedding\n        as planned during this pandemic would put the ones we love, as well as\n        the greater public at an increased risk of exposure to COVID-19. We have\n        jointly made a decision to reduce the event down to our immediate family\n        and alter our date to reduce the risk of our family becoming sick.\n      </p>\n\n      <p>\n        If you have any questions, please feel free to reach out to us directly\n        at{\" \"}\n        <a href=\"mailto:macdonald.erickson@gmail.com\">\n          macdonald.erickson@gmail.com\n        </a>\n        .
